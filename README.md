# FLAME AI Workshop - Superresolution of Turbulent Data

[Workshop Website](https://flame-ai-workshop.github.io)

This is repository for a submission for the Stanford FLAME AI workshop for superresolving turbulent flow data.
The model used is an SR3 diffusion model taken directly from: https://github.com/Janspiry/Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement
The corresponding paper can be found here: [Image Super-Resolution via Iterative Refinement(SR3)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07636.pdf ).
